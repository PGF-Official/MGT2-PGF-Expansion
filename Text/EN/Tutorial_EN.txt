It's important to know that your employees have needs that should be met. Dissatisfied employees tend to quit. Therefore, a <b>lounge</b> and a <b>toilet</b> is a must for any game studio.

The character will automatically go to a desk and wait for your instructions.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click your game character and drop him in the 'Development room'</color>

Once you publish a game, you get experience. For example, increasing experience can decrease development costs or improve the gameplay of your game.<br><br><color=blue>▪ Click on 'Accept'</color>
